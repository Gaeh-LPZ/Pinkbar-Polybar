Hi guys, this is just a simple Project that i made recently, is not such a big thing.
I'm open to critics and ideas to improve and make it look better
If you liked my polybar costumization you can feel free to use it

To make the icons work make sure to download the Hack Nerd Fonts in the nerdfonts.com page, or you can use any other font and any other symbols
The wallpaper that i used for the palet color and also my personal wallpaper was downloaded from wallhaven.cc so check out that page too
i will be leaving the wallpaper in the code also if you want to use it
